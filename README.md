This project builds upon the work from [**OCTDL**](https://github.com/MikhailKulyabin/OCTDL?tab=readme-ov-file) as a starting point:

@article{kulyabin2024octdl,
  title={OCTDL: Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods},
  author={Kulyabin, Mikhail and Zhdanov, Aleksei and Nikiforova, Anastasia and Stepichev, Andrey 
          and Kuznetsova, Anna and Ronkin, Mikhail and Borisov, Vasilii and Bogachev, Alexander 
          and Korotkich, Sergey and Constable, Paul A and Maier, Andreas},
  journal={Scientific Data},
  volume={11},
  number={1},
  pages={365},
  year={2024},
  publisher={Nature Publishing Group UK London},
  doi={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03182-7}
}

To start, an attempt will be made to replicate their training, with future plans to modify, improve, or otherwise take a different approach.  Further modifications to the original implementation will be reflected in this repo.
